User Avatars
Avatars are used to distinguish between different operators and objects when they are shown in a list or in a small space. Users of applications can upload a custom avatar of their choice.

User avatars are automatically generated by the system but can be replaced with an image of the user’s choosing. Colors of generated avatars depend on the first letter of the “Full Name” property.

They are displayed as a 40px x 40px circle.

When avatars indicate a group of users (e.g., a workgroup), avatars should show the first letter of the workgroup name, a single letter, and a white inner border.

Objects can also have avatars. These are distinct from users as they are hollow and square. Object avatars are displayed as 40px x 40px in the UI.
