## Interaction types
Familiar interaction patterns are supported out-of-the-box to support common user expectations.

Keyboard — All apps must be navigable using a keyboard only. Do not use access keys or shortcuts as they typically conflict with the OS, native browser, and accessibility software.

Mouse — Single clicks are used to select / activate items. Hovering can reveal more information. Pressing can activate, pan, or drag some items. Releasing can stop panning or drop items being dragged. Do not use 2x, 3x and right-clicks for interaction as they can cause accessibility issues.

Voice — We support voice commands through third parties such as Amazon Alexa, but do not rely on voice commands for any specific interaction today.

Device sensor data — We support device sensor data, but only use device rotation and location data in the design system currently.

Touch and gestures — In the Pega design system, a touch is handled like a mouse click. As for gestures, we support swiping on toggles and tab pages.
