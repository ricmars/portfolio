Address inputs vary widely from country to country. Pega UX recommends the following pattern for the most inclusive workflow.

1. If available and the user is online, use the Location Autocomplete component to capture user data.
2. Otherwise, if a user's needs are exclusive to a single specific country, find and follow the country standards found on Wikipedia.
3. However, a user's needs may span across multiple countries, in which case use the generic template below (source: Wikipedia)
Country: Fields, labels, and languages may need to change based on this answer, so it must be first.
Street
City area / District
City / Town / Village
County
Postal code
Finally, all address values should use the standard naming found [in the semantic autocomplete attribute spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete#Values).
