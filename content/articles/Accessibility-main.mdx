## Accessibility (a11y)

Designing with accessibility in mind is critical for your application's success, and the legal responsibility of app-makers. We at Pega use the internationally-accepted WCAG 2 AA standards to evaluate an application (a standard now being used by Section 508, EN 301 549 and BITV). 

By user-testing the various ways a person interacts with our interfaces, we craft compliant, inclusive, usable workï¬‚ows to meet any impairment or disability head-on.
