# Accessibility checklist

Making an application compliant to WCAG 2 AA standards can be difficult and confusing at first. To help, here’s a simple checklist for your applications:

HTML is semantic and well-structured. JS is error free.
Every interactive item can be accessed using only a keyboard in the expected order and without being trapped.
All forms, field items, links, page titles, and headers are properly and clearly labeled. (e.g. Not “click here”, but “the article on WCAG”; or not “Name” but, “Your full name”)
All image tags must have an alt attribute set (also known as a tooltip in Pega). Images that are decorative (like an icon in front of a label in a button) can leave the alt value blank. All other images need a clear description. (e.g. Not “A picture of a girl”, but “A little girl on the beach smiling.”)
Any 'All caps' text that is not an abbreviation should be typed in its proper casing, then use CSS to adjust it.
All text has a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 (A sample contrast checking tool)
Do not rely on color or visual position alone to convey meaning and information.
Users must be informed of any important notifications or document changes.
The application is understandable and usable with CSS disabled.
The language on the page and elements that differ from the page are set properly.
Keyboard users should have a quick way to access the various areas of the application.
Frames are named.
Plugins are linked on the page requiring them.
Anything with a timeout (except for live events) must allow a user to extend the time limit.
Do not flash anything over 3 times in 1 second.
Do not auto-play media unless the user set that option.
Time-based media (audio/video) must have an alternate way to understand the content. (i.e. a transcript or captions).
Finally, compliance != usable. Test your newly-compliant application with actual users.
